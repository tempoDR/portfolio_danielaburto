    <p style="font-size:24px; text-align:center">This website course provides
      the opportunity to explore the field of website
      design. In this course we will explore web page design, planning, layout,
      and construction, setup and maintenance of a web site. Using tools such
      as HTML, DTML, and JavaScript will help us accomplish are goals. This
      porfolio will be used to show the things we learn in class by applying them
      to this site.</p>

        <h1>Units we will go through</h1>
         <ul>
          <li><h2>Unit 2:Creating Pages with HTML</h2></li>
            <ol>
              <li>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?
                <ul><li>Some of the important terms that we have learned in this course
                   are doctype and html. Doctype being what tells the computer what
                   certain language will be use in the coding. While html is one of
                    the langeages of coding that there is.</li></ul></li>
              <li>What do you think are the most important skills that you learnedin this unit of study?
                <ul><li>Coding and how to read HTML. Skills such that have to deal
                   with editing text and appearances of my website. Doing all this
                   by using codes to create headings, links, lists, and add images.
                   Also using style coding in order to customize my text.</li></ul></li>
              <li>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?
                <ul><li>Before taking this class, if I was shown anything to do
                  with coding I'd have no idea what I was look at. After attending
                  and growing my skills in the class I'd say I'm confident in the
                  basics of HTML. So far it's easy to learn and understand. It has
                  gotten easy to find the little errors I might make such as forgetting
                  close a tag.</li></ul></li>
              <li>In what ways do you think you need to improve?
                <ul><li>I'm confident in where I am right now with what I've learned.
                  There is always room for improvement, but as far as this Unit goes
                  I've mastered it. I do need to remember the format to add links
                  by heart as to not look back at lessons. Also to memorize the
                  style coding on HTML for text.</li></ul></li>
              <li>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?
                <ul><li>None what so ever</li></ul></li>
              <li>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?
                <ul><li>The entire process was satisfying, from learning the codes
                  to actually putting them into use. But seeing my process on my
                  own little web page was the most satisfying, something I wanted
                  to do.</li></ul></li>
