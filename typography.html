      <h2>Kerning and Leading Assignment</h2>
     <h3>Kerning</h3>
      <p>This paragraph uses kerning to completely fill the 800x300px div below.</p>
      <div id="kerning" class='rectangle'>
      <strong>Kerning</strong> is an adjustment of the space between two letters. The characters of the Latin alphabet emerged over time; they were never designed with mechanical or automated spacing in mind. Thus some letter combinations look awkward without
      special spacing considerations. Gaps occur, for example, around letters whose forms angle outward or frame an open space (W, Y, V, T). In metal type, a kerned letter extends past the lead slug that supports it, allowing two letters to fit more closely
      together. In digital fonts, the space between letter pairs is controlled by a kerning table created by the type designer, which specifies spaces between problematic letter combinations. Working in a page layout program, a designer can choose to use
      metric kerning or optical kerning as well as adjusting the space between letters manually where desired. A well-designed typeface requires little or no additional kerning, especially at text sizes.
      </div>


     <h3>Leading</h3>
      <p>This paragraph uses leading to completely fill the 800x300px div below.</p>
      <div id="leading" class='rectangle'>
      The distance from the baseline of one line of type to another is called line spacing. It is also called <strong>leading</strong>, in reference to the strips of lead used to separate lines of metal type. The default setting in most layout and imaging
      software is 120 percent of the type size. Thus 10-pt type is set with 12 pts of line spacing. Designers play with line spacing in order to create distinctive typographic arrangements. Reducing the standard distance creates a denser typographic color,
      while risking collisions between ascenders and descenders. Expanding the line spacing creates a lighter, more open text block. As leading increases, lines of type become independent graphic elements rather than parts of an overall visual shape and texture.

<!-- Lesson 10 Assignment-->
<!--
  In this assignment, it is highly recommended that you separate your HTML text content into DIVs and/or SPANs, then give them unique ID attributes to style each group individually, or common CLASS attributes to style common groups of elements.

  Remember, to target an element with an ID attribute in your stylesheet, use a hashtag (#) before the ID name. (If <div id="sample"></div>, then the selector is #sample).

  To target an element with a CLASS attribute in your stylesheet, use a period (.) before the ID name. (If <div class="example"></div>, then the selector is .example).
